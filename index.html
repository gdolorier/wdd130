            <p>Hello my name is Gonzalo and I live in Valencia, Spain. I like doing sports like muay thai or padel. I study Business Administration at the university in person in my city. I like the sea and I enjoy life here because I live very close to the beach, in fact I spend most of the summer there.</p>

            <p>Spain is located in Europe, it is a Mediterranean country and much of the lifestyle of its inhabitants is based on their relationship with this sea. We have a varied gastronomy, often considered among the best and healthiest in the world. In addition, we have many tourist and cultural places where we can see the heritage of our ancestors.</p>
